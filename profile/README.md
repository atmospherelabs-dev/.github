  Making Zcash accessible. For everyone.
</p>

---

We build open-source infrastructure that bridges the gap between Zcash's world-class cryptography and the people who need it — users and developers alike.

### Our Work

| | Project | What it does | |
|---|---------|-------------|---|
| 🔐 | **Zipher** | A Zcash wallet designed for humans. Warp sync, cross-chain swaps, testnet support. | Beta |
| 🔍 | **[CipherScan](https://cipherscan.app)** | Block explorer for mainnet and testnet. Verify without revealing. | Live |
| ⚡ | **[CipherPay](https://cipherpay.app)** | Accept shielded Zcash payments. Non-custodial, no KYC. | Live |

### Principles

- **Open Source** — Every line of code is public. We don't ask for trust, we show our work.
- **User Sovereign** — Your keys, your data, your terms.
- **Radically Accessible** — For users and developers alike. Design is our tool, not our goal.
